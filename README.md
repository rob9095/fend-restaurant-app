# FEND Restaurant Reviews App
---
### Description

Convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Make sure the site is fully responsive, accessible, and offline ready.

See the demo here, [https://rt-reviews-app.netlify.com](https://rt-reviews-app.netlify.com)

### Starting the App

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
